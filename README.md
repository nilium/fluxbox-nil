Nil style
===

This is a copy of my Fluxbox style, mostly for the sake of not losing it.

Installation
---

To install the style, either clone or download it into your Fluxbox styles
directory:

    $ git clone https://gitub.com/nilium/fluxbox-nil ~/.fluxbox/styles/Nil

After that, set your style to `Nil`.


Pixmaps
---

If for some reason you want to fiddle with the pixmaps, they're built with
[bmake][bmake] and ImageMagick using pixmaps/Makefile (don't use GNU make -- it
won't work).  Most of the colors, shapes, etc. are just variables. In general,
you probably won't do this.

Credits

The style's theme.cfg is based on the [Numix style by spaceille][numix-style].
Although I don't think it retains any files or content from their style, the GPL
2.0 license has been kept intact and may be read under COPYING.
